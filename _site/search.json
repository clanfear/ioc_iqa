Lanfear cl948@cam.ac.ukOffice 3.9, drop-in times: – Tuesday, 14:00–15:00 – Wednesday, 12:00–13:00 Schedule a meeting\n\n\nIntroduction to Quantitative Analysis (IQA) focuses on training quantitative research methods. Students will learn how to apply the most common and flexible statistical analysis techniques and interpret their results. To facilitate analysis, students will learn modern programming approaches for preparing data for analyses using the R programming language. They will also be introduced to project management and open science principles. IQA is equivalent to two SSRMC courses and covers similar material to Foundations in Applied Statistics and Basic Quantitative Analysis as well as Introduction to R.\n\nMaterials\nThere are two core texts for this course. They are available free online but may be ordered in print form. For the first half of the course, you will mainly be reading about R, as you will be reading about stats in Criminological Research Methods.\n\nHuntington-Klein, Nick. 2021 The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality\nKaplan, Jacob. 2022. Crime by the Numbers: A Criminologists Guide to R\n\nSee the upper right for links to R Resources and Stats Resources for deeper examinations of covered topics and more advanced (but within reach) material.\n\n\nSchedule\nTo see the term schedule, use the link in the upper left to the front page. All content is subject to change as the term develops."

My recommendations here lean a bit toward econometrics as I believe their approaches are the most applicable to common problems in our discipline. For studying unobservable properties of individuals (e.g., self-control, differential association, moral anomie), however, you’ll want to look to sociology and psychology (i.e., psychometrics) and latent variable models (e.g., structural equation modeling).\n\nRecommended Textbooks\nBy level of difficulty and complexity of maths:\n\nLow:\n\nThe two textbooks for this course!\nOpenIntro Statistics by Diez et al. A free and open source introduction general statistics suitable for pretty much anyone.\nOpenIntro Introduction to Modern Statistics by Cetinkaya-Rundel et al. A free and open source stats introduction emphasizing R programming. Still suitable for pretty much anyone. Has interactive R tutorials.\n\nMedium-Low:\n\nData Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models by Gelman & Hill. A classic introduction and reference for multilevel models. Comprehensive.\nStatistical Rethinking by McElreath. A course in bayesian stats that made a big impact on making these methods accessible.\nCounterfactuals and Causal Inference by Morgan & Winship. Classic introduction to causal inference for social scientists. Accessible yet one of the best desktop references.\nIntroductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach by Wooldridge. One of the most used introductory textbooks in public policy and sociology. Rigorous but accessible.\nCausal Inference: What If by Hernán & Robins. A modern introduction to causal inference from the perspective of epidemiology and biostatistics that strikes a nice balance between accessibility and technicality.\n\nMedium-High:\n\nHierarchical Linear Models by Raudenbush & Bryk. The canonical reference for hierarchical models.\nEconometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data by Wooldridge. The canonical reference for econometrics.
