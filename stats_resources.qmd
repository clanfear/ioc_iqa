Statistics is a difficult topic. I recommend learning from multiple sources. My recommendations here lean a bit toward econometrics as I believe their approaches are the most applicable to common problems in our discipline. For studying unobservable properties of individuals (e.g., self-control, differential association, moral anomie), however, you'll want to look to social psychology (i.e., psychometrics) and latent variable models (e.g., structural equation modeling).


# Recommended Textbooks

By level of difficulty and complexity of maths:
   * Low:
      * The two textbooks for this course!
      * [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) by Diez et al. A free and open source introduction general statistics suitable for pretty much anyone.
      * [OpenIntro Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/) by Cetinkaya-Rundel et al. A free and open source stats introduction emphasizing R programming. Still suitable for pretty much anyone. Has interactive R tutorials.
   * Medium-Low:
      * [*Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) by Gelman & Hill. A classic introduction and reference for multilevel models. Comprehensive.
      * [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by McElreath. A course in bayesian stats that made a big impact on making these methods accessible.
      * [*Counterfactuals and Causal Inference*](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107587991) by Morgan & Winship. Classic introduction to causal inference for social scientists. Accessible yet one of the best desktop references.
      * *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* by Wooldridge. One of the most used introductory textbooks in public policy and sociology. Rigorous but accessible.
   * Medium-High:
      * [*Hierarchical Linear Models*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/hierarchical-linear-models/book9230) by Raudenbush & Bryk. The canonical reference for hierarchical models.
      * *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data* by Wooldridge. The canonical reference for econometrics. Covers nearly everything and in depth.
   * High:
      * *Statistical Inference* by Casella & Berger. Often seen as the best first year textbook for statistics graduate students. Deep coverage of fundamentals.
