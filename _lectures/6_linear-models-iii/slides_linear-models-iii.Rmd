# Specification Tests

**Specification tests** are hypothesis tests for evaluating how well a model fits

--

They can be used to test if...

* One model fits better than another

--

* Coefficients are equal to a value (e.g., 0) or to each other

   * The t-test in regression output is doing this!
   * Useful if you're considering *combining* two variables

--

* Many other assumptions are violated

--

*We'll do all of these things by the end of the term, but for now, let's focus on *comparing models**

# `anova()` for Comparisons

The `anova()` function can be used to compare linear models

```{r}
anova(lm_2, lm_3)
```


This produces a chi-square test of whether a given specification significantly reduces the sum of squaresâ€”that is, whether it fits better

--

Here `area` does *not* statistically significantly improve the model

--

This statistical test requires one model be **nested** in the other

---

# Nested Models

Models are nested if every variable in the *less complex* model is included in the *more complex model*

--

When models are nested, we say...

* The less complex one is the **restricted model**
* The more complex one is the **unrestricted model**

--

*What exactly is **restricted**?*

--

Excluding a variable from a model is equivalent to settings its *coefficient to zero*

* i.e., we *restrict the coefficient to zero* when we omit that variable

--

When we exclude a path from a DAG, we *assume a coefficient of zero for that path*

* We can test this assumption using `anova()` and other specification tests
* e.g., if our DAG indicated no direct effect of `area` on `crime_rate`, the prior test would support that assumption

---

# Another Example

```{r}
anova(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3)
```

We can give `anova()` any number of models

* Best to start with the *least complex* or *most restricted*
* Each model is compared to the one directly above it

---

# Warning

Adding a collider to a model will almost always improve fit

* `anova()` only tests if the model fits better
* `anova()` doesn't know about your DAG

--

.text-85[
```{r}
lm_4 <- lm(crime_rate ~ disadvantage + incarceration, data = communities)
anova(lm_1, lm_4)
```
]

--

**Theory** is your first guide for what to include or not

This test is mainly to see if it is okay to exclude *potential confounder*

Pivoting data




---

Do a violence model by month

---

Plot residials

Residuals should be flat with respect to predictors!

You're failing to account for a curved relationship; can't remove a curve by subtracting a straight line

---

Show geom_smooth loess, see the curve


---

Introduce a quadratic polynomial


---

Run the model


---

Plot the residuials


---

Interpet the model


---

Bring back the calculus from first week


---

ggplot(metro_2021, aes(x = month, y = violence_and_sexual_offences)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

ggplot(metro_2021, aes(x = month, y = violence_and_sexual_offences)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2))

fixest::feols(violence_and_sexual_offences ~ month + I(month^2) | borough, data =  metro_2021 |> mutate(month = lubridate::month(month)))
