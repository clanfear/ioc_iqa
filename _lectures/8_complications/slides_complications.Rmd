## Collective Efficacy

Collective efficacy is a problem-solving capacity that explains why crime is concentrated in certain neighbourhoods: it influences social control

## Routine Activity

The built environment explains why crime is concentrated in particular places within neighbourhoods: it influences opportunity

# From the paper

My argument: Neighbourhoods with high collective efficacy in the past will have low crime in the present because they prevented and removed criminogenic features of the built environment

# Neighborhood Model

     data = ccahs_block_analytical_unstd)
```

```{tikz mod-dag, fig.width = 2.75, cache = TRUE, purl = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}

    every node/.append style = {
        draw = none,
        scale = 2
    },
    every path/.append style = {
        arrows = ->,
        draw = black,
        fill = none,
        scale = 1,

    },

My theory says past collective efficacy predicts present crime...

...but only because of effects on the (unobserved) built environment

## Neighborhood Model Results

```{r}
neighb_model |> tidy()
```

>If a block had been in a neighborhood with 1 unit higher collective efficacy in 2001, we'd expect to have seen about `r round(coef(neighb_model)["CE_hlm_2001"], 3)` fewer crimes there in 2004–2006, holding constant 1995 collective efficacy and year 2000 demographic composition.

Note 1995 collective efficacy looks at least as strong as 2001

# Comparing models

.text-80[

The model fits quite a bit better; $R^2$ increases from 0.21 to 0.31 too

]

* 2001 collective efficacy dropped from -0.516 to -0.311 (-40%)
* 1995 collective efficacy dropped from -0.564 to -0.096 (-83%)

# Non-Linearity

Note that there was a **quadratic** term on block-level population density. 

Why did I include that?

--

1. There are some theoretical reasons to expect it
2. It fixed some non-linearity in the residuals
3. It fit quite a bit better:

.text-80[
```{r}
full_noquad_model <- 
  lm(CRIME_violent_2004_2006 ~ CE_hlm_2001 + CE_hlm_1995 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000 + FAC_stability_2000 + FAC_hispimm_2000 + density_ltdb_nc_2000 + 
       density_block + street_class_near + 
       BE_pr_vacant_onstreet_block_2001 + BE_pr_abandoned_bld_onstreet_block_2001 +
       BE_pr_commer_dest_onstreet_block_2001 + BE_pr_recreation_block_2001 +
       BE_pr_parking_block_2001  + BE_pr_commercial_block_2001 + 
       BE_pr_bar_onstreet_block_2001 + BE_pr_liquor_onstreet_block_2001, 
     data = ccahs_block_analytical_unstd)
anova(full_noquad_model, full_model) |> tidy() |> mutate(p.value = round(p.value, 3))
```
]


---

## Quadratic Interpretation

```{r, include = FALSE}
est_vec <- full_model |> tidy() |> 
  filter(str_detect(term, "density_block")) |> 
  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, 3)) |>
  pull(estimate) |>
  round(2)
```

```{r}
full_model |> tidy() |> 
  filter(str_detect(term, "density_block")) |> 
  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, 3))
```

Effect of density: `r est_vec[1]` `r 2*est_vec[2]`*`density_block` 

--

```{r}
ccahs_block_analytical_unstd |> pull(density_block) |> round(3) %>% 
  {setNames(c(min(.), median(.), max(.)), c("min", "mean", "max"))}
```
Effect of density at its max: $`r est_vec[1]` `r 2*est_vec[2]`*0.236$ =  $`r est_vec[1] + (2*est_vec[2]*0.236)`$

---

# Moderation or Interaction

We introduce **interaction terms** when we want to know if effects differ by...

* Groups
* Contexts (e.g., neighborhood)
* Characteristics (e.g., capability)

--

A reviewer asked if disadvantage (a context) **moderated** block-level built environment effects—a common finding in the opportunity literature

* e.g., do some features only produce crime in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods?

I tested this—and we can too!

---

## Moderation test

.text-80[
```{r}
full_int_model <- 
  lm(CRIME_violent_2004_2006 ~ CE_hlm_2001 + CE_hlm_1995 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000 + FAC_stability_2000 + FAC_hispimm_2000 + density_ltdb_nc_2000 + 
       density_block + density_block_2 + street_class_near + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_vacant_onstreet_block_2001 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_abandoned_bld_onstreet_block_2001 +
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_commer_dest_onstreet_block_2001 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_recreation_block_2001 +
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_parking_block_2001  + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_commercial_block_2001 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_bar_onstreet_block_2001 + 
       FAC_disadv_2000*BE_pr_liquor_onstreet_block_2001, 
     data = ccahs_block_analytical_unstd)
anova(full_int_model, full_model) |> tidy()
```
]

Some evidence for moderation, but not strong enough to warrant inclusion!

I did toss the results in the appendix though

## oh no

## Moderation complications

```{r, include = FALSE}
ab_coefs <- full_int_model |> tidy() |> filter(str_detect(term, "abandoned")) |> pull(estimate) |> round(2)
```

What is the effect of abandoned buildings?

```{r}
full_int_model |> tidy() |> filter(str_detect(term, "abandoned"))
```

$`r ab_coefs[1]` + `r ab_coefs[2]`*Disadvantage$

* `r ab_coefs[1] + ab_coefs[2]*-1` when $Disadvantage$ is -1
* `r ab_coefs[1]` when $Disadvantage$ is 0
* `r ab_coefs[1] + ab_coefs[2]*1` when $Disadvantage$ is 1

--

But wait, what's the effect of Disadvantage?

---

## oh noooo

Unfortunately, it depends on *every built environment feature*!

```{r, include = FALSE}
ab_coefs <- full_int_model |> tidy() |> 
  filter(str_detect(term, "disadv")) |> 
  pull(estimate) |> round(2)
```

.pull-left[
.text-80[
```{r}
full_int_model |> 
  tidy() |> 
  filter(str_detect(term, "disadv")) |>
  select(term, estimate) |>
  print(width=40)
```

]
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include = FALSE}
dis_coefs <- full_int_model |> 
  tidy() |> 
  filter(str_detect(term, "disadv")) %>%
  {setNames(.$estimate, str_remove_all(str_extract(.$term, "pr_.*_block"), "(pr_)|(_onstreet)|(_block)|(_dest)|(_bld)"))}
dis_names <- names(dis_coefs)
```

Partial derivative with respect to disadvantage:

$\;`r dis_coefs[1]`$<br>
$+ (`r dis_coefs[2]` * `r dis_names[2]`)$<br>
$+ (`r dis_coefs[3]` * `r dis_names[3]`)$<br>

$+ (`r dis_coefs[6]` * `r dis_names[6]`)$<br>
$+ (`r dis_coefs[7]` * `r dis_names[7]`)$<br>
$+ (`r dis_coefs[8]` * `r dis_names[8]`)$<br>
$+ (`r dis_coefs[9]` * `r dis_names[9]`)$<br>

It doesn't look like our model is doing great

Multiple issues:

* No negative values; a count variable!
* Zeroes: Can't log!
* Non-linearity
* Heteroskedasticity
]

--

These suggest a *better* model; something in the **Poisson** family<sup>1</sup>

You can learn about these in SSRMP modules or textbooks

.footnote[
[1] I used a hierarchical negative binomial model in this paper
]

---

## Common ones to consider

* **Poisson** regression (and related approaches)

   * Counts and other non-negative outcomes
   * Multiplicative relationships
   * Interested in rates

--

* **Binomial**, e.g., logit / logistic regression
   * Binary (0/1) or fractional outcomes (0–1)
   * Interested in probabilities

--

* **Event history** or hazard models
   * Duration outcomes, e.g., time to death
   * Censored data, e.g., with some alive at last follow-up
   * Transitions between states, e.g., incarcerated to free (and back)

--

* **Hierarchical models**
   * Nested data, e.g., blocks in neighborhoods
   * Repeated observations, e.g., person-years
      * **Time series** and **panel models** are included here

---

## Mediation

![:width 80%](img/1_basic_model.png)

<br>

We test for **mediation** when we want to know if an effect works through a *particular* front door, e.g., $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$

--

Mediation requires strong assumptions (sequential ignorability):

* You've identified the effect of $X \rightarrow Z$
* You've also identified $Z \rightarrow Y$

This is *very hard* to do, but if you want to do it, read VanderWeele (2015) *Explanation in Causal Inference: Methods for Mediation and Interaction*

---

## Fixed Effects

One problem with my analysis is I don't observe *change* in the built environment—I only had one time point!

* There might be unmeasured differences between neighborhoods or blocks explaining my effects
* If I'd had at least two measures, I could make a more convincing test by *looking only at changes*

--

**Fixed effects** or **unobserved effects** models are one way to do this:

* Introduce a categorical variable with a level for *every unit* and/or time period
   * e.g., 31 borough dummies in our `metro_2021` data
* This "controls" for *mean differences* between the units
   * i.e., it adjust for anything *stable over time*
* This is a type of **hierarchical model**
   * Specifically, one where fixed characteristics of units are a *nuisance*

--

This is *very easy* and *very common*, but see Huntington-Klein chapter 16 for more
