# London Crime

Let's load another example dataset: 

Real Metropolitan Police recorded crime in the 32 London boroughs (no City of London) in 2021

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
metro_2021 <- 
  read_csv("https://clanfear.github.io/ioc_iqa/_data/metro_2021.csv")
```

I obtained these from `data.police.uk`—it is easy to get your own for nearly anywhere in the UK, and in any recent period.

I also linked them to data on deprivation and subregions, which would take more work!

---

# London Crime


```{r}
glimpse(metro_2021)
```

---

# `distinct()`

These data have monthly observations for each borough.

If we wanted to look at only unique observations of boroughs, we can use `distinct()`

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  distinct(borough) |>
  head()
```

---

# `summarize()`

Just as a quick check, let's see how many boroughs and months are in the data

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  summarize(n_boroughs  = n_distinct(borough),
            n_months    = n_distinct(month),
            sample_size = n())
```

Looks like every borough is seen in 12 months

```{r}
32 * 12
```

---

# Another Check

A different way to see if all boroughs are observed 12 times is to count observations of each borough twice

```{r}
metro_2021 |> count(borough) |> head(3)
```

--

Okay, then count how many of each value of `n`

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
metro_2021 |> count(borough) |> count(n) # This makes a warning! #<< 
```

Every value of `n` was 12, so there were 32 values of 12.

---

# Saving a Subset

If we think a particular subset will be used repeatedly, we can save it and give it a name like any other object:

```{r}
westminster <- metro_2021 |> filter(borough == "Westminster")
head(westminster, 4)
```

# `ggplot2`
  
An alternative way of plotting many prefer (myself included) uses the `ggplot2` package in R, which is part of the `tidyverse`.





```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

The core idea underlying this package is the [**layered grammar of graphics**](https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098): we can break up elements of a plot into pieces and combine them.

# Structure of a ggplot
  
`ggplot2` graphics objects consist of two primary components:
  
--
  
**Layers**, the components of a graph.

* We *add* layers to a `ggplot2` object using `+`.
* This includes lines, shapes, and text.

--
  
**Aesthetics**, which determine how the layers appear.

* We *set* aesthetics using *arguments* (e.g. `color="red"`) inside layer functions.
* This includes locations, colors, and sizes.
* Aesthetics also determine how data *map* to appearances.

---
  
# Layers
  
**Layers** are the components of the graph, such as:
  
* `ggplot()`: The initial plot canvas
* `geom_point()`: Scatterplot points
* `geom_line()`: Lines between data points
* `labs()`: Plot title and axis labels
* `facet_wrap()`: Divides plot into a sequence of panels
* `facet_grid()`: Divides plot into a grid of plot panels
* `theme_bw()`: Replace default gray background with black-and-white

Layers are separated by a `+` sign.

---
  
# Aesthetics
  
**Aesthetics** control the appearance of the layers:
  
* `x`, `y`: $x$ and $y$ coordinate values to use
* `color`: Color of elements based on some data value
* `group`: Describe which data points are grouped together (often used with lines)
* `size`: Size of points/lines based on some data value
* `alpha`: Transparency based on some data value

---
  
## Aesthetics: Setting vs. mapping
  
Layers take arguments to control their appearance, such as point/line colors or transparency (`alpha` between 0 and 1).

--
  
* Arguments like `color`, `size`, and `fill` can be used directly on layers (**setting aesthetics**), e.g. `geom_point(color = "red")`. These *don't depend on the data*.

--

* Arguments inside `aes()` (**mapping aesthetics**) will *depend on the data*, e.g. `geom_point(aes(color = continent))`.

--

* `aes()` in the `ggplot()` layer gives overall aesthetics to use in other layers, but can be changed on individual layers (including switching `x` or `y` to different variables)

--

This may seem pedantic, but precise language makes searching for help easier.

--

Now let's see all this jargon in action.

Say we tabulate our data and see this association in our sample:

It looks like disadvantage has different patterns in rural and urban areas

How do we figure this out?

# Chi-square Test

`janitor` adds a `chisq.test()` function that works on its special tables

```{r}

--

This is the same result we saw in CRM yesterday: There appears to be an association.

# A Prettier Table

There are many ways to make nicer looking tables in R

For very simple tables using dataframes, I use `kable()` in `{knitr}`

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
communities |> 
  tabyl(disadvantage, area) |> 
  adorn_title() |> 
  knitr::kable() # Access a package function without loading it #<<
```

.footnote[
Yours won't have the colored rows—that's from my website theme!
]

---

# More Complex

If you want to make a publication ready table that will work in any output format, such as PDF, Word, or HTML, [your best bet is `{flextable}`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/)

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(flextable)
communities |> 
  rename(Disadvantage = disadvantage) |>
  tabyl(Disadvantage, area) |>
  flextable() |>
  add_header_lines("Table 1. Disadvantage by area")
```

It can be complicated, but it can do just about anything...

```{r barplot-1, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(communities, 
       aes(x = disadvantage)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

`geom_bar()` tabulates counts of values of categorical variables and makes a bar plot

]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("barplot-1", "svg")`)
]

---

# Filled Bar Plots

Adding a `fill` aesthetic will color the bars by a second variable

.pull-left[
```{r barplot-2, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(communities, 
       aes(x    = disadvantage,
           fill = area)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("barplot-2", "svg")`)
]

---

# Dodgy Bar Plots

Adding `position = "dodge"` in `geom_bar()` will unstack them

.pull-left[
```{r barplot-3, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(communities, 
       aes(x    = disadvantage,
           fill = area)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("barplot-3", "svg")`)

# `lm()`

We can run an OLS linear model in R using `lm()`

--

It takes a **formula** as the first argument, e.g. `y ~ x`

```{r}
cr_pd_lm <- lm(crime_rate ~ pop_density, data = communities)
cr_pd_lm
```

By default, it won't produce much output—you probably wanted significance tests!

---

# `summary()`

To get detailed output, use `summary()` on the output from `lm()`

.text-85[
```{r}
summary(cr_pd_lm)
```
]

---

# `lm()` Output is a List


`lm()` produces a lot more information than what is shown by `summary()` however. We can see the structure of `lm()` output using `str()`:

.text-85[
```{r}
str(cr_pd_lm, list.len=6) # Truncating the output a bit
```
]

`lm()` actually has an enormous quantity of output! This is a type of object called a list.

---

# Digging Into a List

We can access parts of lm() output using $ like with dataframe names:

```{R}
cr_pd_lm$coefficients
```

We can also do this with summary(), which provides additional statistics:

```{r}
summary(cr_pd_lm)$coefficients
```

---

# `broom::tidy()`

A quick way to get model output into an easy-to-use format is with the `{broom}` package's `tidy()` function

```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(cr_pd_lm)
```
--

`tidy()` turns model output into a dataframe—now you can use `dplyr` with it!

```{r}
tidy(cr_pd_lm) %>% filter(term == "pop_density")
```

---

# `broom::augment()`

`{broom}` can also add regression results back to your original data using `augment()`

This includes **predicted values** and **residuals**

```{r}
cr_pd_lm |> augment() |> glimpse()
```

We'll use this later to do model diagnostics!

---

# Plotting Regression Lines

`geom_smooth()` is used to add conditional mean lines to plots—the regression line is just one type of these!

.pull-left[
.text-85[
```{r comm-lm, fig.show='hide'}
communities %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_density, 
             y = crime_rate)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Population Density", 
       y = "Crime Rate") +
  geom_smooth(method  = "lm", 
              formula = "y ~ x") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

By default it includes a confidence interval along the line

This is the CI for the mean *at each level of `x`*

]
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("comm-lm", "svg")`)
]

---

# More Lines

If you group your data, you can draw a regression line for each separately—equivalent to running a separate model on each group

.pull-left[
.text-85[
```{r comm-lm-area, fig.show='hide'}
communities %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_density, 
             y = crime_rate,
             group = area,
             color = area)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Population Density", 
       y = "Crime Rate",
       color = "Area") +
  geom_smooth(method  = "lm", 
              formula = "y ~ x") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```
]
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("comm-lm-area", "svg")`)
]

# Wrap-Up

* That was a lot this week!

   * Take the week off on this course—focus on CRM and your other courses

* Next week will have an assignment handed out

* Most of the rest of the course is figuring out how to apply all this

   * Plus learning some more programming tools!
