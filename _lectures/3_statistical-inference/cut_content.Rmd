# London Crime

We'll revisit the shootings data again soon.

For now, let's load another example dataset: 

Metropolitan Police recorded crime in London boroughs in 2021

```{r}
metro_2021 <- read_csv("https://clanfear.github.io/ioc_iqa/_data/metro_2021.csv")
```

---

# London Crime


```{r}
glimpse(metro_2021)
```

---

# `distinct()`

These data have monthly observations for each borough.

If we wanted to look at only unique observations of boroughs, we can use `distinct()`

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  distinct(borough) |>
  head()
```


---

# Counting

We used `table()` earlier to tabulate a categorical variable

In `dplyr`, we can use `count()`

First, I get `distinct()` values so we're not counting each borough 12 times (once for each month)

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  distinct(subregion, borough) |>
  count(subregion)
```

---

# Proportions

We can add a column of proportions

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  distinct(subregion, borough) |>
  count(subregion) |>
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))
```

Most boroughs are in the East subregion—East is the **modal** category

---

# Cross-Tabs

`count()` can take multiple variables for cross-tabulation

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  distinct(borough, subregion, deprivation) |>
  count(deprivation, subregion) |>
  head()
```

The output doesn't look like a normal two-way table, however—we'll learn to **pivot** the table into that format another day!

# Summarizing

**`summarize()`** takes your column(s) of data and computes something using every row: 

* Calculate the mean
* Calculate the standard deviation
* Obtain a minimum or maximum value

You can use any function in `summarize()` that aggregates *multiple values* into a *single value* (like `sd()`, `mean()`, or `max()`).

---

# `summarize()` Example

Let's get the number of observations and mean and SD of robbery for June 2021

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  filter(month == "2021-06-01") |>
  summarise(n_obs = n(),
            mean_robbery = mean(robbery),
            sd_robbery = sd(robbery))
```

These new variables are calculated using *all 32 boroughs (rows)* observed in June

---

# Another Example

Let's get the number of observations and mean and SD of burglary for Westminster

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  filter(borough == "Westminster") |>
  summarise(n_obs = n(),
            median_burglary = median(burglary),
            sum_burglary = sum(burglary))
```

---
  
# `group_by()`


The special function `group_by()` changes how functions operate on the data, most importantly `summarize()`.

Functions after `group_by()` are computed *within each group* as defined by variables given, rather than over all rows at once.

Excel analogue: pivot tables

# `group_by()` example


```{r}
metro_2021 |>
  group_by(month) |> #<<
    summarise(n_obs = n(),
            mean_robbery = mean(robbery),
            sd_robbery = sd(robbery)) |>
    head(5)
```

Because we did `group_by()` with `month` then used `summarize()`, we get *one row per value of `month`*!

Each value of month is its own **group**!

---

# Another Example

```{r}
metro_2021 |> 
  group_by(borough) |> #<<
  summarise(n_obs = n(),
            median_burglary = median(burglary),
            sum_burglary = sum(burglary)) |>
  head()
```


`summarise()` works with any functions that take a *vector* as an argument (input) and return a *single number* as an output (value)

# Saving a Subset

If we think a particular subset will be used repeatedly, we can save it and give it a name like any other object:

```{r}
westminster <- metro_2021 |> filter(borough == "Westminster")
head(westminster, 4)
```
