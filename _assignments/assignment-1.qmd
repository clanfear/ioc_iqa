# Fundamentals

## Running a Cross-Tab

Load the data here:

Then make a crosstab of X and Y.

## Central Tendency

Using the data from the previous question, calculate the mean and median of each of X and Y

# More Challenging

Using the data GHGH, make a scatter plot of X and Y using `ggplot2`.

Interpret the linear regression output below.

# Harder Problems

## DAG to Estimator

Given this DAG and the data here:

Run a linear model that identifies the effect of X on Y

```{r}

```
