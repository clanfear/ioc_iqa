Copy-pasting output from the console is fine, so long as it is passably formatted: format pasted code (but not written text) with a fixed-width/monospace font like Courier or Monaco. Cropped screenshots are fine for console output or plots (only show the relevant parts). Written answers should be brief and to the point!\n",
