# Materials

There are two core texts for this course. They are available free online but may be ordered in print form. For the first half of the course, you will mainly be reading about R, as you will be reading about stats in *Criminological Research Methods*.

-   [Huntington-Klein, Nick. 2021 *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality*](https://theeffectbook.net/)

-   [Kaplan, Jacob. 2022. *Crime by the Numbers: A Criminologists Guide to R*](https://crimebythenumbers.com/)

See the upper right for links to R Resources and Stats Resources for deeper examinations of covered topics and more advanced (but within reach) material. Return to the lecture view using the link in the upper left.
