I recommend learning from multiple sources. My recommendations here lean a bit toward econometrics as I believe their approaches are the most applicable to common problems in our discipline. For studying unobservable properties of individuals (e.g., self-control, differential association, moral anomie), however, you'll want to look to social psychology (i.e., psychometrics) and latent variable models (e.g., structural equation modeling).\n\n\n\nBy level of difficulty and complexity of maths:\n\n   * Low:\n      * The two textbooks for this course!\n      * [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) by Diez et al. A free and open source introduction general statistics suitable for pretty much anyone.\n      * [OpenIntro Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/) by Cetinkaya-Rundel et al. A free and open source stats introduction emphasizing R programming. Still suitable for pretty much anyone. Has interactive R tutorials.\n   * Medium-Low:\n      * [*Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) by Gelman & Hill. A classic introduction and reference for multilevel models. Comprehensive.\n      * [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by McElreath. A course in bayesian stats that made a big impact on making these methods accessible.\n      * [*Counterfactuals and Causal Inference*](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107587991) by Morgan & Winship. Classic introduction to causal inference for social scientists. Accessible yet one of the best desktop references.\n      * *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* by Wooldridge. One of the most used introductory textbooks in public policy and sociology. Rigorous but accessible.\n   * Medium-High:\n      * [*Hierarchical Linear Models*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/hierarchical-linear-models/book9230) by Raudenbush & Bryk. The canonical reference for hierarchical models.\n      * *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data* by Wooldridge. The canonical reference for econometrics. Covers nearly everything and in depth.\n   * High:\n      * *Statistical Inference* by Casella & Berger. Often seen as the best first year textbook for statistics graduate students. Deep coverage of fundamentals.\n\n# Assorted Resources\n\n* [Library of Statistical Techniques](https://lost-stats.github.io/) curated by Nick Huntington-Klein.\n* [Common statistical tests are linear models]( https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) by Jonas Lindel√∏v"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"stats_resources.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"flatly","title":"Stats Resources","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
